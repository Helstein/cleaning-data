## About
This repository contains files for course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera. The main file here is "run_analysis.R" which, when run on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, produces a tidy dataset that summarizes subset of variables within the original subset (variables that represent mean and standard deviation of measurements). Section "How to Run" provides instruction how to run the script. File "CodeBook.md" summarizes the steps used to produce the tidy dataset and provides details about the variables within it.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Extract the original dataset to the directory where script "run_analysis.R" is located (or modify the "datasetBase" variable within the script to point to the base directory of the dataset)
3. Run "run_analysis.R"
